# python-challenge
Each assignment folder has its designated script under "main.py". The Analysis folder has the text output file from running the code and the Resources folder has all csv files used for each assignment. 

Sources for my codes:

-Activities within the 03 Python Module

-Bill's pseudo code for how to construct PyBank script

-The Zoo Example Bill provided for reference on the dictionary for PyPoll

-A reference for incorporating the dictionary into the text file output for PyPoll was from the link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-dictionary-to-a-file-in-python/
